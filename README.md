cispablackout.js
===============

This is a Javascript utility to blackout websites on April 22, 2013. this utility will overlay a popup linking to [sitesnotspies.org](sitesnotspies.org)

If you have a non-SSL site, simply add this before your `</body>`:

`<script type="text/javascript" src="http://thedod.github.io/cispablackout/cispablackout.js"></script>`

At the moment, the only solution for SSL sites is to [download]() the code and serve it locally.
You'll also need to fix the url at `cispablackout.js` (search for <em>FIX ME</em>).

Good luck.
